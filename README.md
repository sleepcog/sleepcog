Hello, I am Minjee Kim, MD, Associate Professor of Neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.

I am dedicated to advancing the understanding of sleep as a critical, yet often underestimated, determinant of cognitive health and overall well-being. At the **SleepCog Lab**, our research is driven by the belief that **quality sleep is a fundamental human right**, and that its preservation is essential for healthy aging.
  
In today's face-paced world, sleep health is under constant threat, prompting the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to label sleep loss as a “public health epidemic.”
This epidemic is linked to a wide array of health issues, including hypertension, diabetes, depression, obesity, and cancer.
Despite the growing recognition of poor sleep as a global issue, it remains largely invisible in clinical settings.
To illustrate, consider the analogy of high blood pressure: effective treatments exist, but they are useless if the condition is undiagnosed.  Similarly, without identifying sleep problems early, the risk of downstream health consequences remains high.

Therefore, our primary focus is on **developing and evaluating innovative interventions for the early detection and treatment of poor sleep**. By proactively addressing these challenges, we aim to reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.

Our research methodology integrates validated questionnaires with wearable devices to comprehensively assess **sleep health**. 
We also investigate novel approaches to extracting **circadian rhythm** — our internal biological clock — signals from patterns of activity and light exposure, recognizing their close connection to sleep health.

Furthermore, we are harnessing the expanding capabilities of **electronic health records (EHR)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)** to develop scalable, practical interventions that can be widely implemented to help people achieve better sleep.

We welcome opportunities for collaboration! We can be reached at SleepCogNU@gmail.com.
